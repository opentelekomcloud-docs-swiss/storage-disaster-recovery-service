Overview
========

Welcome to *Storage Disaster Recovery Service API Reference*. Storage Disaster Recovery Service (SDRS) provides cross-AZ disaster recovery (DR) protection for servers. It supports recovery point objective (RPO) equal to 0, greatly reduces RD TCO for enterprises, and simplifies the DR process. If a fault occurs at the production site, you can quickly restore services at the DR site. This significantly shortens service interruptions and reduces loss.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on protection groups, protected instances, and replication pairs, and perform DR drills. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <sdrs_02_0000>`.

If you plan to access SDRS through an SDRS API, ensure that you are familiar with SDRS concepts. For details, see section "Overview" in *Storage Disaster Recovery Service User Guide*.
